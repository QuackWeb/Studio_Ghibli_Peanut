					</p>

					<h2 class="mt-4">The theme of humanism and nature</h2>
					<p>
						While the poetic animation invites us into the world of Ghibli, what makes us stay are the feel-good themes of humanist
						sensibilities. Catering to its younger audience, the movies have a tone of didacticism where they intend to teach some form of
						lessons or insights through their stories. These are essentially coming-of-age stories where the characters go on an adventure
						which metaphorically becomes a journey of growing up and to a large part highlight the relationship with nature. The
						philosophy of humanism pins importance on humans and their individualism, focusing on ideas of freedom and empowerment as well
						as seeing nature as an extension of self. Hence, along with deeply personal themes, the distinguishing factor of Studio Ghibli
						is its portrayal of nature. <i>Miyazaki explains</i>,
					</p>
					<p class="px-3 quote">
						“We don't subordinate the natural setting to the characters... That is because we feel that the world is beautiful. Human
						relationships are not the only thing that is interesting. We think that weather, time, rays of light, plants, water, and
						wind—what make up the landscape—are all beautiful. That is why we make efforts to incorporate them as much as possible in our
						work.”
					</p>

					<h2 class="mt-4">Romanticization of the ordinary</h2>
					<p>
						Delving further into the humanist themes, a distinct yet common trait of Studio Ghibli films is the romanticization of
						everyday life. Unlike Disney films which are often rooted in deep, tragic conflict; conflicts in most Ghibli films do not do
						the heavy lifting of building narrative but are instead, fleeting and quite simple. The pace of the film is steady with
						importance given to ordinary and mundane actions: Sophie making hats in Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo enjoying his meal, Shizuku
						studying in Whisper of the Heart, Takashi and his wife Matsuke fighting over the TV remote in My Neighbor Yamadas are few of
						many instances which celebrate the beauty in mundane.
					</p>
					<p>
						These quiet and sombre moments may not necessarily push the story forward but allow opportunities for worldbuilding as they
						establish the time and space of the characters' world. Miyazaki terms it <i>'Ma'</i> which in Japanese means emptiness.
					</p>
					<p class="px-3 quote">
						“If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it's just busyness, but if you take a moment, then the
						tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you just have constant tension at 80 degrees all the time you
						just get numb.” -Miyazaki
